  about: ['About StudyVeda', 'StudyVeda is a free MCQ practice platform.', <>
    <p>StudyVeda helps students prepare for competitive exams, university courses and interviews by practising multiple-choice questions with clear explanations.</p>
    <p>Every question is written or reviewed by our editors, tagged by subject, topic, exam and difficulty, and can be practised in two ways: <strong>Practice mode</strong>, which shows feedback after each answer, and <strong>Test mode</strong>, which hides answers until you submit.</p>
    <p>StudyVeda is an independent project. It is not affiliated with the Staff Selection Commission, Railway Recruitment Boards or any other exam-conducting body.</p></>],
  contact: ['Contact', 'Contact the StudyVeda team.', <>
