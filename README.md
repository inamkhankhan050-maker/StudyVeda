# StudyVeda — Learn Smarter. Practice Better.

An original MCQ practice platform: a static React site for **GitHub Pages**, with **Supabase**
(PostgreSQL + Auth + Row Level Security) as the database and security layer.

* Public site: 5 categories, 47 subjects, 13 SSC/Railway exams, topic pages, search, practice sets
* Practice engine: Practice mode (instant feedback + explanation) and Test mode (answers hidden until submit, optional timer), mark for review, question palette, score/accuracy, full review, retry incorrect, saved progress & bookmarks
* Admin panel at `/admin`: dashboard with live counts, subjects, topics, exams, questions (create / edit / duplicate / preview / publish / unpublish / delete, filters, pagination), CSV bulk import with row-level validation, CSV export, practice-set builder
* 84 original published sample questions (+2 drafts) across 25 subjects, 6 practice sets

> GitHub Pages only serves static files. It does **not** host the database or run any admin
> logic. All data, sign-in and permissions live in Supabase.

## 1. How security works

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| `public.admins` table | Lists administrator user IDs. It has **no insert/update/delete policy**, so no browser user (not even a signed-in one) can add a row. Only the SQL Editor (database owner) can. |
| `public.is_admin()` | `security definer` function that checks the caller's `auth.uid()` against `admins`. |
| RLS on every table | Public (anon + students) can only `select` **published** subjects/topics/exams/sets and **published** questions whose subject *and* topic are published. Every write requires `is_admin()`. |
| Student data | `attempts` and `bookmarks` are readable/writable only by their owner (`user_id = auth.uid()`). Results can't be edited after saving. |
| Database constraints | Unique slugs, 4 distinct non-empty options, `correct_option in (A,B,C,D)`, topic must belong to the question's subject, duplicate question text per subject blocked, subjects/topics with content can't be deleted. Timestamps and `created_by` / `updated_by` are set by triggers. |
| Frontend | Uses only the public **anon** key. The admin screen check is a convenience; the database rejects any non-admin write regardless. The app refuses to run if a `service_role` key is configured by mistake. |

## 2. Set up Supabase (free tier, about 10 minutes)

1. Create an account at https://supabase.com → **New project**. Choose a region near your users (e.g. Mumbai), set a database password, wait for it to start.
2. **Create the schema:** Dashboard → **SQL Editor** → **New query** → paste all of `supabase/migrations/001_schema.sql` → **Run**. Then do the same with `supabase/migrations/002_comments.sql` (question discussion: only logged-in users can read/post).
3. **Load the catalog + sample questions:** new query → paste `supabase/seed.sql` → **Run**. (Safe to re-run.)
4. **Auth settings:** Dashboard → **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
   * **Site URL:** `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`
   * **Redirect URLs:** add `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/**` (and `http://localhost:5173/**` for local development)
   * Authentication → **Sign In / Providers** → Email: keep enabled. "Confirm email" on is recommended.
5. **Create the first administrator**
   1. Authentication → **Users** → **Add user** → **Create new user** → enter your email + a strong password → tick *Auto Confirm User*.
      (Or sign up on the site's `/login` page and confirm the email.)
   2. SQL Editor → open `supabase/create_first_admin.sql`, replace `YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL@example.com` with that email, **Run**. The final `select` should show one row.
   3. Sign in at `/login`, then open `/admin`.
   To add more admins later, repeat step 5.2 with their email. To remove one, use the `delete` line in the same file.
6. **Get the public keys:** Project Settings → **API** (or **API Keys**)
   * **Project URL** → `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   * **anon / public** key (or the new **publishable** key) → `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   * ⚠️ Never use the `service_role` / **secret** key anywhere in this project.

**Free plan (supabase.com/pricing, checked Oct 2026):** $0/month, 500 MB database, 50,000 monthly active users, 5 GB egress, 1 GB file storage, no automatic backups, max 2 active projects, and free projects are **paused after 1 week of inactivity** (restore from the dashboard). Export your questions with the admin "Export CSV" button regularly as a backup. The built-in email sender is heavily rate-limited — fine for testing; add custom SMTP (Authentication → SMTP, free on all plans) before real sign-ups. Nothing is charged unless you upgrade to a paid plan.

## 3. Deploy on GitHub Pages (free)

1. Create a GitHub repository (e.g. `studyveda`) and push this folder to the `main` branch.
2. Repository → **Settings → Pages** → *Build and deployment* → **Source: GitHub Actions**.
3. Repository → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables** tab → **New repository variable**:

   | Name | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | your Project URL |
   | `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | your anon/publishable key |
   | `VITE_BASE_PATH` | `/StudyVeda/` (your repo name between slashes; `/` if you use a custom domain) — optional, defaults to `/<repo>/` |
   | `VITE_SITE_URL` | `https://USERNAME.github.io/studyveda` — optional, used for canonical URLs + sitemap |

   These are *public* values (they ship to every browser), so Variables are appropriate; using Secrets also works.
4. Push to `main` (or Actions → *Test and deploy* → **Run workflow**). The workflow runs the unit + database security tests, builds, and publishes. The site appears at `https://USERNAME.github.io/StudyVeda/`.

**Routing on GitHub Pages:** every known page (all subjects, topics, exams, sets, static pages, admin screens) is written as its own `index.html` with its own title/description/canonical, so direct visits and refreshes return 200. Any other URL (e.g. a subject you add later in the admin panel) is served by `404.html`, which loads the same app and renders the right page.

Without the two Supabase variables the site builds in **demo mode**: everything works, but data is stored only in the visitor's browser and the admin panel is open (clearly labelled). Don't launch publicly in demo mode.

## 4. Run locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local      # fill in your Supabase URL + anon key (or leave blank for demo mode)
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:5173
```

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | regenerates seed files, builds `dist/`, writes per-route HTML, 404.html, sitemap.xml, robots.txt |
| `npm test` | unit tests: scoring, validation, CSV import/export, seed integrity |
| `npm run test:db` | runs the real schema + seed + RLS policies in an in-process PostgreSQL (PGlite) and attacks it as anon, student and admin |
| `npm run test:e2e` | browser tests of the built site (needs `npx playwright install chromium`) |
| `npm run seed` | regenerate `supabase/seed.sql` + `src/data/seed.json` after editing `scripts/seed-data.mjs` |

## 5. Managing content

* **Subjects** can belong to several categories (Computer Fundamentals is in both Competitive Exams and Computer & Programming without a duplicate row). Status: Draft / Published / Archived. Subjects with topics or questions can't be deleted — archive them.
* **Topics** belong to one subject; unpublishing a topic hides its questions everywhere.
* **Questions** start as Draft. "Preview & publish" shows the student view before it goes live. Unpublished questions never appear on public pages, search, or practice sessions.
* **CSV import** (`/admin/import`): download the sample, fill it, upload. Every row is validated (required fields, A–D answer, distinct options, subject/topic/exam exist, duplicates against the bank and inside the file) and previewed with row numbers before anything is saved. The summary lists created / skipped / failed rows.
  Columns: `question,option_a,option_b,option_c,option_d,correct_option,explanation,subject,topic,difficulty,status,exam,tags,source,image_url` (first 7 required; tags separated by `;`).
* **Export CSV** on the Questions page downloads the whole bank in the same format (backup / bulk editing).
* **Practice sets** reference questions (no copies). Draft questions in a set stay hidden until published. Sets can be timed (1–600 min), previewed and archived.

## 6. Project structure

```
supabase/migrations/001_schema.sql   tables, constraints, triggers, views, RLS policies
supabase/migrations/002_comments.sql per-question discussion (login-only read/post, own/admin delete)
supabase/seed.sql                    catalog + sample questions (generated)
supabase/create_first_admin.sql      grant admin to an existing user
scripts/seed-data.mjs                source of the catalog + sample questions
scripts/build-seed.mjs               → seed.sql + src/data/seed.json
scripts/postbuild.mjs                per-route HTML, 404.html, sitemap, robots
src/lib/api.js                       data access used by all pages (lazy-loads one backend)
src/lib/supabaseBackend.js           Supabase queries (anon key + RLS)
src/lib/demoBackend.js               localStorage backend for demo mode
src/pages/*                          public pages + practice engine (Play.jsx)
src/admin/*                          admin panel
tests/                               unit, database (RLS) and browser tests
.github/workflows/deploy.yml         CI tests + GitHub Pages deploy
```

## 7. Known limitations

* Answers for published questions are downloaded with the question so practice works on a static host; a determined user can read them in the browser's network tab. Test-mode scores are computed in the browser and are for self-assessment, not proctored exams. (A server-side scoring function would be the next step if you need that.)
* Pre-rendered HTML (titles/descriptions for search engines) is generated from the seed catalog at build time. Content added later in the admin panel works for visitors immediately but is only pre-rendered after you update `scripts/seed-data.mjs` and redeploy; otherwise it is served via `404.html` (HTTP 404 status for crawlers).
* Page body content is rendered by JavaScript; search engines that don't run JavaScript only see the title/description.
* Image upload isn't built in — questions take an image **URL** (e.g. from Supabase Storage or any https host).
* The contact address and legal pages are templates; replace them before launch.
